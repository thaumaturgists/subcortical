## Under the bark

Inadvertently, the project I am working on has been underway since 2016, 2017–2018, 2019–2021 reformation, and the book itself from 2021 to the present.

Even if it's a mess, it's my mentality that keeps me from acting or moving, and when I do, it's because I want a better world.

I tried to determine the boundaries of wrongdoing in the world in 2019. It was limitless, and the deed even brought unnecessary attention to me in a hidden world.

Who knew what the actual world was like? The longer I maintained my composure and endured the mocking pain, the more absurd it got.

I discovered that, like a shadow, there were others who wanted every miracle I performed to be a lie.

### Truth

No sin is ever new and that is the limit of sin

Since I am the only one who truly knows my thoughts and actions, I shall use myself as the truth in the world. I used my personal information as an anchor.

Since I write constantly and could do so indefinitely, I have not yet rotated the content to my liking in the majority of cases.

Together, let's create something lovely.
