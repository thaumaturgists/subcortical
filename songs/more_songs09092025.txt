I am quite fond of Latin.

How so?

Well, for one, you are so kind and you seem to care a lot.

858, a man saves the children of the world, because his children would have children and those children would have children, and so on... This included the children of the whole world to eternity. A man tried to save a woman, but she killed him in the end if he kept on with her, and so in the end he saves the world so that the children or anyone else never suffers this same fate.
youToday at 10:26 PM
This was beautifully written! Thank you!
